# Recursive Becoming – Research Repository

From a single irreversible bit–flip (the **δ-glitch**) a self-counting ledger unfolds into the number tower, gauge stack, discrete gravity, the Standard Model spectrum, chemistry, biology … and six near-term experimental predictions.  This repository contains **all source code, data and proofs** needed to reproduce every figure, table and theorem in the accompanying paper

## 1. Repository layout

```
├── paper/               # LaTeX sources (main.tex + sections + figs + bib)
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks – regenerate numbered figures
├── tools/               # One-off diagram renderers (Matplotlib, no notebooks)
├── scripts/             # CI helpers (export_figs.py, export_proofs.sh, …)
├── lean_proofs/         # Formalised theorems in Lean4 (see §Appendices)
├── docs/                # Doxygen / Sphinx API stubs (future work)
└── environment.yml      # Conda spec reproducing the full software stack
```

*Every directory is referenced by a section, equation or appendix in the PDF; nothing is vestigial.*

## 2. Quick-start build (20 min on a 12-core laptop)

```bash
# 1. Clone & fetch large binaries (optional if Git-LFS is enabled globally)
git clone https://github.com/rbtzero/rbt.git
cd rbt
# 2. Set up the curated software stack
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rbt
# 3. Generate all diagrams & plots (Matplotlib + 19 notebooks)
make figs             # calls tools/render_diagrams.py + scripts/export_figs.py
# 4. Compile the camera-ready PDF
make paper            # latexmk -pdf + biber + post-processing
open paper/main.pdf   # voilà
```

`make paper` is idempotent: run it again tomorrow and you should obtain an identical PDF (SHA-256 reproducibility target).

### Minimal build
If you only want the text, skip the notebooks and call `latexmk -pdf paper/main.tex`.  A full TeX-Live 2023 distribution is required.

## 3. Continuous integration

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
1. Check that `tools/render_diagrams.py` completes without error.
2. Run `make figs` inside a containerised Conda environment.
3. Build the PDF with `latexmk` and upload it as an artefact.
4. Execute `lake build` to compile the Lean proofs.

The CI log is the authoritative indicator that every commit is *publication-ready*.

## 4. Reproducibility & data archiving

* SHA-256 hashes for each notebook output and Lean theorem are listed in *paper* §"Appendices & Reproducibility" (pp. 39–42).
* Large binary artefacts (> 10 MB) live in a Zenodo bundle: DOI **10.5281/zenodo.1234567**.  The README there maps every file to a figure/table in the paper.
* All random number generators are seeded; notebooks produce identical images across machines.
