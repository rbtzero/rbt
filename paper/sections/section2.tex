% TODO: core axioms of RBT.
RBT is built on four irreducible axioms:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Irreversible Seed.}  A single bit transition from 0\,$\to$\,1 occurs at $t=0$.  The transition is logically irreversible and therefore unrecordable \emph{within} the pre-existing state.
  \item \textbf{Self-Counting Ledger.}  The universe consists of an ordered list of binary strings $S_t$ whose $(t+1)$-st element is the binary encoding of the length of $S_t$.  That is, $S_{t+1} = \operatorname{bin\_enc}(|S_t|)$ concatenated to $S_t$.
  \item \textbf{No External Reference.}  All observables and laws must be expressible as relations internal to $S_t$; no appeal to external clocks, rulers, or parameter values is permitted.
  \item \textbf{Local Consistency.}  Any algebraic rule inferred from a finite prefix of the ledger must remain valid when applied to all future extensions.  This enforces a form of causal locality reminiscent of Conway's "no irreversible inference" principle.
\end{enumerate}

In the sequel we demonstrate how these axioms imply energy--momentum conservation, Lorentz symmetry, and gauge invariance to leading order in a coarse-grained expansion.
